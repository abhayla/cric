# Autonomous PR + auto-merge handler — so closing a session lands the work without touching git.
#
# Wired into SessionEnd (fires when the session closes). Companion to auto-git.sh:
#   auto-git.sh (SessionStart+Stop) — commits + pushes each turn's work to a task branch.
#   auto-pr.sh  (SessionEnd)        — opens a PR for that branch and ARMS native auto-merge,
#                                     so GitHub squash-merges it the moment the project's required
#                                     CI checks go green, then deletes the remote branch.
#
# PREREQUISITES (configure once, per repo): GitHub branch protection on main with required
# status checks, repo-level auto-merge enabled, and delete-branch-on-merge enabled. Without a
# required check, `--auto` merges immediately (no green-gate) — so set at least one required check.
#
# Why SessionEnd, not Stop: arming auto-merge after every turn would merge work mid-session.
# Arming on close matches "close the session and forget about the branch".
#
# FAIL-SAFE: always exits 0 (a gh/network hiccup must never block session close).
# GUARDRAILS:
#   1. Never opens a PR for main/master or a detached HEAD.
#   2. Only arms auto-merge — GitHub still gates the actual merge on the required CI checks.
#      A red or pending CI leaves the PR open and unmerged (no lost work, nothing forced).
#   3. Idempotent — re-running reuses the existing PR; never opens duplicates.
# OFF-SWITCHES:
#   AUTO_PR_DISABLE=1 -> do nothing at all.
#   AUTO_MERGE=0      -> open/refresh the PR but do NOT arm auto-merge (you click merge yourself).
#                       Set this for repos where a human must approve every merge to main.
