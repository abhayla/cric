# prompt-enhance-reminder.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook
# Injects the *Enhanced:* indicator + Tier-1 + Grade pipeline reminder so the
# advisory rule cannot be skipped under context pressure.
#
# Trigger gate (added v2): the hook itself filters trivial prompts so the
# strengthening pipeline never runs on continuations or one-word replies.
# This moves the "skip for direct instructions" rule from the model layer
# (where it can be missed) to the deterministic layer.
#
# Skip conditions (no reminder injected):
#   1. Prompt length ≤ 15 characters (after trimming whitespace)
#   2. Prompt matches a known continuation phrase (yes / ok / thanks / next /
#      go ahead / proceed / continue / now do … / same for … / also …)
#
# Configuration:
#   Event: UserPromptSubmit
#   Matcher: (empty — matches all prompts)
#   Exit codes: always 0 (non-blocking)
#   Stdin: JSON payload with `prompt` field (parsed via jq)
#
# Settings.json entry:
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "UserPromptSubmit": [
#         {
#           "matcher": "",

#             { "type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/prompt-enhance-reminder.sh", "timeout": 3 }
#           ]
#         }
#       ]
#     }
#   }

# Stderr is silenced so a missing jq never surfaces in the conversation.

Required parts, in order: (1) *Enhanced:* banner; (2) pipeline transcript (per-step); (3) a before→after grade card WITH the independent reviewer's per-dimension 'Reviewer-after' column; (4) Original→Final strengthened prompt, fenced (Final opens with 'Act as …' when Role&Framing < 7); (5) 'Role: <name> — <why>'. The compact 'What changed / Final prompt' block is a FALLBACK ONLY when the user explicitly asked to reduce verbosity — do NOT default to it. On a genuinely trivial/continuation prompt render ONLY '*Enhanced: no change — ran your input as-is*' as the first line. Deferring the process until after tool work, or omitting the reviewer card, is a defect the Stop + PreToolUse hooks BLOCK. SSOT: prompt-auto-enhance-rule.md 'MANDATORY OUTPUT'."

  echo "PLAN BEFORE CODING: for any non-trivial change (3+ files/steps, new feature, refactor, schema, or domain-critical logic) produce a visible plan — plan mode / autonomous contract / inline plan block — BEFORE the first code edit (.claude/rules/plan-before-coding.md). Skip only trivial/mechanical edits (typo, one-line fix, rename)."

ONLY a genuinely irreversible/outward/strategic action (deploy, spend, DNS cutover, destructive git, a true product fork) earns a question. A Stop hook (no-overask-guard.sh) flags violations."
  echo "GRILL WHEN UNSURE OF INTENT (equal-weight balance to DECIDE-DON'T-ASK): the ban above is ONLY on permission-to-START / approval questions when you ARE in sync. If you're NOT SURE WHAT THE USER IS ASKING — you may have understood something else, OR there are 2+ materially-different valid ways to build it and the user hasn't delegated — you MUST STOP and grill (grill-me), one question at a time, to get in sync BEFORE working; never start while unsure of intent (this holds even if the user said 'you decide'). Open such a genuine intent question with a *Sync-check:* banner — the no-overask hook EXEMPTS that marker (it's required clarification, not over-ask). SSOT: decision-authority.md 'Confidence gate'."
  echo "DON'T NARRATE-AND-STOP (hard rule, equal to DECIDE-DON'T-ASK): do NOT end by DESCRIBING the next step (\"next step is…\", \"next I'll…\", \"the continuation is…\", \"remaining work tracked in…\", \"from here…\") and then stopping. If the next item is reversible/internal, EXECUTE it now in the same turn — keep going through the whole queue until only a genuine blocker (escalation / your credentials / a destructive op) remains. The Stop hook BLOCKS a narrate-and-stop and re-injects this rule so you continue."
